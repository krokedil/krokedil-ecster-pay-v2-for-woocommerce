Gulp

- After cloning the repo, run 'npm install' (no quotes) from plugin directory
- Before editing plugin files, run 'gulp watch'
- To create plugin zip file, do one of these:
  * 'gulp build' to create zip file in /build/
  * 'gulp build --version x.y' (use actual version) to create zip file in build/x.y/

'gulp build' will compress JS, compress CSS, generate language files and create the zip file
